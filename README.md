# Pillars of OOP

This project is for beginners or developers looking for a refresher to understand the four main pillars of Object Oriented Programming. In this tutorial, I will explain what they are, how they are used, and best use cases. I also an article version of this here: https://dev.to/kcooperdev .


### What They Are:

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance

### Motivation:

I am a self taught developer myself, with no background of computer science. I strongly believe these concepts are vital to do well as a software engineer to have a successful career. It also allows you, as a engineer to focus on writing clean and maintainable code that is easier to debug and refactor.

## Best Use Cases

**Encapsulation** - use to hide a specific property or method and making them only accessible within the scope of the function or constructor. For example, you are with some friends and have a piece of cake in a public environment, those friends have also have access to your piece of cake but if you take your piece of cake to another area which is private or protected then the piece of cake is no longer accessible to your friends. This is a real world example of encapsulation.

**Abstraction** - use to hide unnecessary details, only show the esentials. For example, when you go to the movies, there is an entire process, on the front end, the consumer goes and buys tickets at the counter, buys snacks, then go sit down and watch the movies. On the backend, The consumer doesn't need to know how the tickets are received or how they are printed out, or how the popcorn is made, or how the butter and salt are added to the popcorn or how the movie is displayed onto the screen, these are the unnecessary details. The consumer only cares about the main parts, those are the essentials. This is a real world example of abstraction.

**Polymorphism** - can create many forms, or many implentations of a duplicated method, can also extend classes, which means it can use the functionality within those classes in another class. A great example would be a Human Being. For example, the human being is a father, the father can talk, run , and walk. He becomes a new dad and has a son, the son inherits the father abilities and the son now can talk , run and walk and can also add his own abilities and functionalities such as drawing, and swimming. The father can also have more children, and it will follow the same with the son. Those kids would inherit or extend the same capablities as the father, and have access to the father abilities as well.This is a real world example of polymorphism.

**Inheritance** - can be use to inherit or receive the features or methods from an existing class. When using inheritance, the class that is receiving features of an existing class is called a subclass and the class that is being inherited is called a super class, which is just the parent class. The difference between inheritance and polymorphism is, polymorphism is determined at runtime, so the methods that are being extending or use in another class, at runtime, it is being invoked. Polymorphism can also change the behavior of the parent class. However, inheritance does not change the behavior of the super class, it inherits or receives the methods instead.
An real world example of inherits would be a old phone and new phone, a new phone inheritance the functionality of an old phone which includes phone calling, messaging, volume buttons, screen display, etc...
