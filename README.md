# Pillars of OOP
This is a project is for beginners or developers looking for a refresher to understand the four main pillars of Object Oriented Programming. In this tutorial, I will explain what they are, how they are used, best use cases, and a couple implementations in a couple languages. 

### What They Are:

* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance

### Motivation:

I am a self taught developer myself, with no background of computer science. I strongly believe these concepts are vital to do well as a software engineer to have a successful career. It also allows you, as a engineer to focus on writing clean and maintainable code that is easier to debug and refactor.
